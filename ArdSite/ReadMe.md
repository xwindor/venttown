Steps to get website working:
1. to run the site off your computer I recommend using XAMPP thats what I have been using
2. change the lines in the two PHP files with file_put_contents and file_get_contents to contain a valid path for where to write the log file
3. In the arduino file: change the server to your internal IP set the ssid, pass and keyIndex for your network lastly replace any instances of google.com with your internal ip address
